Generate a directory_structure.md file for my project. Loop through the entire project directory recursively and list all folders and files in a tree-like structure using markdown formatting.

    Use indentation or tree symbols (├──, └──, │, etc.) to represent folder hierarchy.

    Include both directories and files.

    Sort entries alphabetically within each directory.

    Ignore hidden files and directories (those starting with a dot).

    Do not include node_modules, dist, build, or any other typical dependency/output folders.

    Format the markdown cleanly and wrap it in triple backticks for readability if needed.

Now, loop through the actual folder and generate the real structure in that format.
